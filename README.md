My exploratory analysis will be using the Global Terrorism Index 1970-2017.
The purpose of the analysis will be to dig deeper into the data set to find trends and insights to what is happening and happened across the world within the realm of global terrorism. I will read the file into a Pandas dataframe. Clean it. Use the the cleaned dataframe for analysis and graph plotting. Graph plotting will be done using Seaborn, Matplotlib and 2 graphs will be created using Tableau. I will screenshot the graphs and relevant blocks of code to present all the information in a keynote/powerpoint file. Finally I will write a script to the presentation, detailing my findings, insights and conclusions of the information. Presentation on Friday! :)
